![Ashley Souk](/img/souk.png){ .top-left } In December 2019, **Ashley Souk** joined the Office of Advancement as Assistant Director. Born and raised in Champaign, Illinois, Ashley earned her bachelor’s degree in Organizational and Leadership Communication and Political Science from Illinois State University. 

Prior to coming on board at the College, she worked at Home Sweet Home Ministries in Bloomington, Illinois as a donor relations coordinator raising funds in a variety of ways for people experiencing homelessness. 

“Scholarships have the ability to change the trajectory of a young person’s life, and I can’t wait to be a (very) small part of helping students achieve an Illinois education. Being raised by a single teenage mom, graduating from a four-year university was not just a goal, it was my dream.”
